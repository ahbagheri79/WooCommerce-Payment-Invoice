Installation Instructions:

First, create a page in WordPress with any desired name, preferably "invoice".
Create a file named page-invoice.php in the root directory of your WordPress theme.
Then, navigate to the page you created and select the "Invoice Template" theme.
That's it!
Now, your customers can access their respective invoices using the following link:
Sample.domain/invoice?id=order_id

Note:

For privacy protection, if the invoice doesn't exist, users will encounter a 404 error.
If the requested invoice doesn't belong to the current user, a 403 error will be encountered.
